# Deepfake Detection

## üìå Overview  
This project focuses on detecting deepfake videos using deep learning techniques. It explores various models, including **VGG16**, **LSTM**, and custom **binary classifiers**, to differentiate between authentic and manipulated media.

## üß† Models Implemented  
- **VGG16 Model**: Utilizes the VGG16 architecture for feature extraction and classification.  
- **LSTM Model**: Employs Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture temporal dependencies in video frames.  
- **Binary Classification Model**: A custom model designed for binary classification tasks in deepfake detection.

## üöÄ Usage

**Prepare the dataset:**
Ensure that train.csv and test.csv are properly formatted and placed in the root directory.
Download the full dataset from Kaggle (see below).

**Run the desired model notebook:**
Open the notebook (e.g., VGG16 Model.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
Execute the cells sequentially to train and evaluate the model.

**Visualize results:**
Refer to animation.gif for a visual representation of the model's performance.
